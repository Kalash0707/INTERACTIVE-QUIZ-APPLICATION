## PROJECT DESCRIPTION : 

The Interactive Quiz App is a fully functional, web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to participate in a multiple-choice quiz, receive instant feedback, track their score live, and view a dynamic leaderboard at the end. 

The app begins with a welcome screen where users can enter their name, which is then used to personalize their quiz session and leaderboard entry. Once the quiz starts, questions are displayed one at a time, each with four answer options. When a user selects an answer, immediate feedback is given—correct answers are highlighted in green, incorrect ones in red, and a brief message is shown to indicate the correct choice. A "Next" button then appears, enabling users to move to the next question at their own pace. 

Throughout the quiz, the current question number and the user's live score are shown at the top, providing real-time progress tracking. After completing all questions, the application displays a congratulatory message along with the user’s final score in a clearly styled result box. To ensure users get a moment to view their performance, the app waits for 2.5 seconds before transitioning to the leaderboard screen. 

The leaderboard ranks the top scores using browser-based localStorage, making the data persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed. It shows the top five scores in descending order and includes the player’s name for recognition. Users also have the option to restart the quiz, resetting all progress and returning to the home screen. 

This project includes essential features such as user personalization, dynamic question rendering, instant feedback, real-time scoring, result display, persistent storage, and a responsive interface. It is ideal for self-assessment tools, educational purposes, trivia games, and skill evaluations. 

The application is lightweight and requires no backend server, making it easily deployable on static hosting services like GitHub Pages or Netlify. Its modular and scalable structure allows for future upgrades such as integrating timed questions, question banks from APIs, or even online multiplayer functionality using Firebase. 

The project demonstrates core front-end concepts like event handling, DOM manipulation, conditional logic, and local storage. Its clean interface and interactive flow make it a valuable learning tool for new developers and an impressive portfolio addition. Whether used for fun, education, or testing knowledge, the Interactive Quiz App delivers a smooth and rewarding experience to users. 

It is a great starting point for anyone learning JavaScript or looking to build real-world web projects that go beyond static pages. With all its core functionalities and user-friendly design, the quiz app not only fulfills the purpose of testing knowledge but also showcases strong UI/UX principles and solid programming fundamentals. The built-in leaderboard adds a competitive edge, motivating users to improve their scores and keep playing, thereby increasing engagement. 

In summary, this project offers a well-rounded combination of learning, functionality, and interactivity, making it both educational and enjoyable.
